---

**Game genre, short introduction**
Fantasy CRPGs (Computer Role-Playing Games) with online elements have been a thing for over 45 years. Fast forward to current times there's two or three main categories of CRPGs: primarily single player RPGs with either soulslike or tactical approach, or MMORPGs. CRPGs borrowed heavily from TTRPGs like Dungeons & Dragons.

See Game loops for more info.

**Sormus as a game**
An elevator pitch would be something like this:
In a world where the sun hasn't risen for a generation about to experience a massive upheaval as gates to other dimensions open to fill the shadows with new dangers and old legends raise their heads in a cry towards a new order.

Create a character. Create a playstyle. Change the world (minor). Learn about the past. Forge the future. Fight bosses. Change the world (major). Celebrate. Mourn. Purify.

A visually sound experience paired with battle-tested pen and paper -like mechanics.

A game meant to restart your agency.

Emotional and epic story.

**Superior Pillars**
o Everyone should be able to play
- Pursue flow state without requiring perfect execution, this is power fantasy.
- Casual players is a segment that could become strong allies, it's a value to let everyone play, to let everyone be able to experience the story.
o Aim for an immersive experience, not a game
- Stories are eternal. They need to be told convincingly.
- Immersiveness adds value & transcends our messages into the real world.
- Reimagining games moves the industry forward.
- Is this too gamy?
- If realism is against fun, side with the fun.
o Nourish Creativity & Connection
- Humans are social animals and want to show their individuality through fashion, builds, choices
- Humans crave community in hyper individualistic age, provide that
o The game is something groundbreaking in more than one area.
**Major Pillars**
o Game Balancing should be made PvP in mind (like in GW1).
- This can lead to well balanced content.
- No billions of damage like other ARPGs.
o Combat should be actiony and movement oriented with telegraphed attacks (both animation and ground cues etc) the player needs to dodge or block. Or eat.
o Small numbers the user can wrap their head around, over big numbers.
- See Summoner(?).
o There should be explorationary feel in the world and game mechanics.
**Minor Pillars**
o Anything is possible with creativity.

Narrative Pillars (3-5)
o TODO Evoke X emotion(s)
o TODO best in class in some genre (arpg?)

Narrative Tone: TODO (similar/same tone to game/movie?) 

**Why is it fun?**
Sandboxiness, action combat, great story, roguelike moments, customization, multiplayer

**Why do the players keep coming back (Retention)?**
- Time gated content
- Sandbox nature
- Takes a long time to experience everything
- Story content is not good bang for buck for retention.

**What do the enemies do?**
- Use largely same skills as players.
- Patrol or appear from portals.
- Sometimes live their lives.
	- as opposed to just waiting the player with their weapons.

**Game loops**
The main loops of an rpg consist of growing stronger and experiencing more of the story.
Popular activities in rpgs are clearing dungeons, gearing up, customizing your character and playstyle, creating characters in different archetypes, getting achievements, achieving long term goals, achieving mastery, teaming up with others for content, clearing hard content, unlocking new content, replaying story if it has replay value, completing quests.

*Gearing up*
Find better or more fitting gear for your character with bonuses that benefit your playstyle. To get more gear you need to play the game to find those drops, or get money to buy or craft gear. Once you have better gear you can experience more content or the same content. To get some gear you need well geared characters. No gear treadmill though.

*Clearing dungeons*
A roguelikeish experience that offers replay value and exciting moments. Thriving in this environment is easier with a well progressed character (via dungeons exp/drops) or with friends.

*Filling community goals*
Progressing in the game sometimes requires participation from the whole community. The player does for example procedural content to fill the goal. The story and progress in the world is gated like in Sea of Conquest: Pirate War. This is a recurring thing.

*Progressing in the story*
Requires community goals, beating bosses, finding items, playing content. Story is made for each expansion.

*Customizing playstyle*
Player plays to unlock more skills and gear to play more or in the fashion they choose.

### Setting
The continent is Xylrea and the events take place at its west side which is a human realm, formerly a monarchy. New age, year 0, began when monarchy was toppled. 

// Todo add info 
// History of the entire world.
// Detailed history of the area where the story unfolds.
// Inhabitants: people, characters, animals, monsters, etc.  

**Timeline of past game events** (from WorldEmber, limited free tier)

**End of monarchy by the Council**

0 CE

Failing to prevent the anger of dragons, monarchy was deemed to be an unfit way to rule the human kingdom. It was just the last nail in the coffin. The Council naturally took over and increased their influence.

Kings and queens did not cease to exist, but their power was severy limited, and for example the amount of paladins the king could have was cut to a fraction.

There was a clause in the new law that could reinstate the royal reign by democratic decision, in the case it was absolutely needed.  
  
As the Council rose to power it marked the start of a new era, year 0, as opposed to the high elves year system.


**War against the Forest Elves**

23 CE to 25 CE

A silly war started by the Council that was about the elves not helping with sea trade, or the lack of it. The elves would be needed to keep the dragons away.  
  
The dragons harnessed a spiteful anger towards humans ever since wizards in the northern coast used magically infused dragon eggs to transform people into draconic beings in search for greater power. Not the best idea if you ask anyone now. There's not much left of the coastal wizards, or sea traveling, except through the Still Sea for anyone that would dare it.

In any case the spoils of the loss such as magical equipment are spread among The Great Trees for those that dare to go there. The other great trees besides the ones in the Stand of Time have been cut down on the left side of the mountain except a select few, for example near the king's castle in the northwest.

**The Shipwreck Coup by King Ero II**

36 CE

Ever after securing a peculiar magical ring King Ero II saw that it is best to return the old power, the not so old ways. The Councils rule was not for everybody, even though they did some seemingly good things also. The king was also against war so he decided a bloody coup was in order.

Ero II had to recruit people from other lands who sailed through the Still Sea, and got to live to tell the tale. They got through though not in one piece. This made stopping the coup very easy.

Ero was later killed for this treason. A performance that did not please his son who got a front row ticket.

The King's former paladins were spread all over the lands at this point, those that were still alive as the paladins were pretty old. They did not have any part in this coup. There was, and still is couple paladins that the King gets to keep, so that didn't change.


**The nights turn noticeably longer and longer**

70 CE

Nights start to last 2 or 3 days inconsistently.

Some of the dwarves of Ronnook delve into the sky high mother mountain in search for the inner mechanisms to fix the sky lights.

**King Ero III fathers Desideria**

76 CE

The king who already has two children fathers a third child, a bastard child, with a persuasive seer.  
  
Desideria lives in secrecy with her mother in a cabin in the woods near the castle. The king makes hunting trips and other outdoorsy treks to be a part of her life.

  

**Desiderias mother dies, then raised by the Last Paladin Rachfort**

86 CE

King's close friend and a paladin looks after Desideria. Of course the King keeps visiting her too.


**Rachfort starts training his successor Will**

91 CE

Sent by the church as the most promising kid willing to take on the lifestyle. Lack of food had Will's guardians send him to the church of the All Seeing some years earlier from the north side of the mountain. At this point Will is a scrawny but gritty young gentleman with some of orc blood.

Will is trained in the castle.


**Will gets his true name**

93 CE

Uncommon for paladins Will does get a true name. This makes him able to cast generally more powerful spells but Rachfort who gives the name does not tell the name to Will which again limits the efficiency of this language based magic. This magic is all about the price you pay, like most other types too. Usually paladins only use magic powered by the king's gemstones that they have embedded on their armour.  

When Desideria turned 15 she did not get a true name. This oddly does not stop her from learning language based magic.


**Rachfort leaves to guard The Boundary**

94 CE

And leaves Will to finally protect Desideria. They are both around the same age, 18 at this moment.

There's also widespread rumours of the "king" having a hidden heir, a bastard child, a hidden prince. Possibly several. This is not that big deal however.

  
**Demon attacks ravage the land**

97 CE

Attacks mainly in the south, in a different kingdom, and some in the north and some in the east.  
  
This sets off a chain of events that lead to the great darkness, a period where our heroes start their jouney and a period of struggle for Will and Desideria. (EDITORIAL NOTE: player characters don't start their journey here, only story NPCs background that gets visited in flashbacks)


### Story
The story takes place in a continent known as Xylrea that has experienced a long lasting darkness but people have survived, often by magical means to grow food.

A new age begins, as does your story. Long forgotten portals open and new puzzling futures are divinated. The player experiences a story half told, half untold by taking a look into the past, to different days, and then forging the future with the help of other heroes.

Currently there's 150 years of history, in media res starting point for the players, beginning and end, and story outline. The story is a combination of hopepunk and a splash of portal fantasy in a dark fantasy setting. There's a focus on stories experienced by real people in this totally real land.

**Essential characters**
Princess Desideria
Paladin Will
Archmage Esmar & apprentice Sandra
Hul's Council members (4)
Dwarves of Ronnok (~4)
Darkness personified
Important characters here and there

**What if the player kills essential friendly characters?**
Impossible to kill friendly characters. For Will, Esmar the player would be seriously outmatched. Killing Sandra would be a very bad decision and might result in failure as well. Killing friendly Dwarves would be a morally evil thing and the story isn't about that. The story is about friendship and tolerance and flowers.

## System Interfaces

### Character System Interfaces

##### Attributes
There are 5 different attribute points that can go from 0 to 3. 0 means normal ability in a stat (another word for attributes) and 1 then means strong in the context on strength, 2 means very strong, and 3 unbelievably strong. 

A balanced hero character would assing 5 of these attributes to their 5 attributes. A legendary hero could assign 6, which the player grows into during their playthrough. When player starts they assign 3 stat points which make their class archetype so to speak. Players can't assign 3 points to a single stat at character creation though it is possible when the player gets their first respeccable (or perhaps second or third) attribute point.

Player can get additional freely respeccable attribute points at certain levels (see leveling). Respeccing can't be done in an active instance.

The main attributes are:

**Strength (Str)**
Physical strength. Increases physical damage dealt. Requirement for proficient use of certain equipment. Increases carry capacity.

**Dexterity (Dex)**
Nimbleness and aim and control of body and movement. Dexterity helps you both land a hit and avoid hits.
// TODO determine whether this has effect max speed from skills

**Constitution (Con)**
Constitution increases your health and helps you regain it and protects you from some ill effects.

It is also how much your body resists adverse effects like poison (10 % per level) and how healthy you are and how much beating you can take (in part it also is your grit/spunk/perseverance. Your commitment to go on). 

**Spirit (Spi)**
Spirit is your magical connection to the world. It aids you in spellcasting.

Combination of how in tune you are with arcana and spirit world and natural spellcasting ability and willpower/determination/intuition. Increases spell damage. Decreases damage from spells. Increases ability to resist spells.

**Knowledge (Kno)**
Knowledge measures your knowledge, expertise in techniques and your learning ability. With low learning speed learning and mastering new techniques such as perks and skills is slower but the same end result can be achieved in most cases.

Measures how much advanced knowledge and technique you possess. Applies to arcana fighting and skills and languages. Requirement for proficient use of certain items or spells. 

Simple weapons don't need proficiency from Kno and everything is still usable with low Kno.

Amount of languages spoken is increased by 1 for every 2 Kno. Languages help in barter prices, getting quests and reading signs. Perhaps 1 kno for basics of language (though there could be dictionaries and such).

##### Skills
Player can use ~8 skills and these skills can be modified (like in TQ2). Skills are learned by doing/seeing/getting training. Skill modification amount is normally capped at 8. Modifying a skill with major or minor effect always costs the same 1 point but only 1 major modification can be on at the skill simultaneously. The skills are not locked to certain "classes" but might have varying requirements to use, for example in stats or weapons.

Skills can be freely respecced outside of active instance.

Skills have a basic/unlearned version that gets better with use but the player can't just grab any skill, they need to initially get exposed to it enough first.

Examples of skills, more in Skills Compendium outside of GDD:

Backstab
Cost: 5 mana, 0 adrenaline
Prequisites: Hit from back.



##### Perks
There are a lot of different perks to discover and activate. Couple handful can be active at the same time. A major perk requires training but might be able to be skipped and replaced with normal perk. Minor perks can be slotted to minor slots which might be more common in the chosen perk slot UI if there are multiple configs to choose from. Major perks require major slot. Some perks can be leveled up. Knowledge stat boosts perk learning as do some other stats for selected perks.

Respeccing is free but must be done outside of active instance.

Perks havea a basic/unlearned version that gets better with use but the player can't just grab any perk, they need to initially get exposed to it enough first.

##### Class description & Background description
Characters have a background for roleplay purposes to tie them to the character and world and give them motivation to progress in the story. A background can be a normal profession or a hero profession or self made. This is part of roleplaying. A battlemage, berserker, shaman, ranger, blacksmith, Knight of the Shattered Rose - anything goes. One can hide others backgrounds/self made class descriptions if they wish. There are very many pre-made class descriptions as the game lacks traditional classes. At character creation class desc and background descriptions are filled. Game can suggest the players things based on these (like stat allocations, starting weapons, starting skills & perks).

Changing these is free as it is only flavour.

##### Races
The game supports different races/ancestries: 
- Human
- more to be added later such as Wood Elf, High Elf (which are not suited to live under Xylrea's moon), Dragonmorph human, maybe differently rigged and built character races if possible (minotaur, centaur).

### Character creation

**Player selections during character creation**
- Assign 3 stat points which make their class so to speak. Non re-speccable as this is the core character strength. (eg. 2 points in Str and 1 in dex would make for a good fighter base as it can be extended to couple directions)
- Stat points can be allocated freely and there is also a randomize function. Some ancestries have restrictions on stats (classes requiring points in 2 stats start with 4 to allocate so that there is some freedom) but humans have none and start with 3.  
- Training: Assign starting major perk (which is a class identity like necromancer which allows to raise more undead etc), you can change your training at any point by seeking class training quests. 
- Assign class name from recommended ones or make one up. Can be changed at any point.
- Appearance: many different ways to customize character (unlike most ARPGs until TQ2 which is in EA)
- Players select a starting untrained class identity perk & skill, weapon. More with higher Kno.
- Player assigns a name for their character (can also be private name).
- Player chooses whether to make a solo character and/or permadeath character. Solo status can be switched back and forth but to keep fully solo badge the player can't buy or sell equipment from other players (but they can give equipment away). Permadeath has its own badge as well.

##### Leveling Up
Player can level up by getting experience from quests, actions (broadly), exploring, combat.

When player gainst a level they gain various benefits.

Level - Effects
2 - Starting level (1 perk, 1 skill, 1 weapon (w/ autoattack), more depending on Kno)
3 - 1. Proficient Skill Modify Point + 1. Known Skill Proficiency Unlock (unlock skill proficiency from known skills (can try out skills before that with less effective version)) + 1. Known Perk Proficiency Unlock
4 - Proficient Skill Modify Point, Known Skill Proficiency Unlock, Known Perk Proficiency Unlock  
5 - Respeccable Stat/Attribute point, PSMP, KSPU, KPPU
6 - Raise available skills amt (5), PSMP, KSPU, KPPU
7 - PSMP, KSPU, KPPU
8 - Raise available skills amt (6), PSMP, KSPU, KPPU
9 - PSMP, KSPU, KPPU
10 - Respeccable Stat/Attribute point + Raise available skills amt (7), PSMP, KSPU, KPPU
11 - 2 KSPU, 2 KPPU
12 - Raise available skills amt (8), 2 KSPU, 2 KPPU
13 - 2 KSPU, 2 KPPU
14 - 2 KSPU, 2 KPPU
15 - Respeccable Stat/Attribute point (maybe part of challenge like quest that unlocks at 15), 2 KSPU, 2 KPPU
16 to 100 - 3 KSPU & 3 KPPU until at max (even then keep raising if new skills and perks come).

Leveling takes roughly an hour with first levels being a bit faster. So a character that wants to use 8 skills and 6 stat points for endgame content (complicated build as there is also energy management) has to play roughly 15 hours to get it. A character that can do with 5 attribute points could do that in 10 hours or less. It is recommended to be level 15 with completed stat point quest to beat story but it can be done earlier with skill and/or good gear, even relatively early, lets say level 6 although that requires some raids which might not be easy but they also have low-combat paths.

Leveling also unlocks other game systems bit by bit to not overwhelm player.

Leveling also raises health amount by 5 + 1 * Constitution amount until level 15 and then by 3 + 1/3 * Con after level 15 (non-Con players start to catch up).

**Respeccing**
Respeccing perks and skill modifications is free (and half of attribute points) and can be done from players regular UI outside of combat instances. Build exploration is encouraged. Another way to test is to make a PvP character (PvP not included). Respeccing character set in stone character attribute points (3) is discouraged but enabled with an in game item that one can get by completing the campaign or buying as mtx. 

In other games respeccing is impossible (between LE masteries) or costs a lot (LE skill trees) meaning a player might want to create 2 characters per character class (which is also a problem in a game like GW2 since its hard to hold that much equipment on one character even if respeccing is free).

##### Status Effects
Game supports lots of status effects. The closest inspiration is GW1 & GW2.

**Conditions** (Negative)
For some conditions there is a build up time before the condition comes into effect or it is first not as severe.

Conditions from Guild Wars are close to perfect but should be tweaked to fit the game, culled from unnecessary ones and new conditions should be brainstormed that fit the game.

Conditions are applied with skills and environmental effects. 

- Bleeding (stackable up to creature resistant and applier skill)
	- Medium- effect
	- Common.
- Poisoned (stackable up to creature resistant and applier skill)
	- Medium+ effect
	- Not common.
- Sandblind/Samblind (semi-blind)
	- 33 % miss rate
	- Longer duration.
- Blind
	- 90 % miss rate
	- Short duration, rare
- Burning
	- Strong effect but not long lasting.
- Crippled
	- Movement speed decrease.
- Dazed
	- Spells take 33 % longer to cast and have 33 % interruption chance when the caster is hit
	- Medium duration, rare
- Deep Wound
	- Max health is reduced temporarily. 
	- Medium duration.
- Disease
	- Spreads if it can, weak effect but can grow over time.
- Weakness
	- Slows attack speed, lowers damage by 1 tier (2)
	- Cannot crit
	- Medium+ duration
- Cracked armor 
	- Stacks up to wearer's armor level.
	- Medium duration
- Slown I/Slown II/Slown III/Slown IV
	- Reduces movement speed by 25 % 33 % or 50 % or 90 %
	- Might just be part of hexes or other status effects as there is already crippled

Health or mana affecting conditions are indicated in the UI by colors and pips or equivalent system.

Multiple different conditions can be active on the same character. Reapplying a condition that is already present will add to the stack size if possible & change duration to its duration if it is a longer than existing effect duration. 

**Hexes** (negative)
Various bespoke effects. Cost more than conditions. Multiple different hexes can be active on the same character.

Hexes are applied with skills.

**Enchantments** (positive)
Various bespoke effects usually dealing with basic game mechanics such as dodge chance, regeneration, healing, armor, speed etc. Might have upkeep cost or initial cost. Multiple different enchantments can be active on the same character.

Enchantments are applied with skills. 

**Environmental Boosts**
There might be environmental buffs that are not enchantments per se and are unstrippable such as being in a healing spring.

**Morale** (positive or negative)
Boost or decrease stats until entering outpost. Gained with failing or completing gameplay goals in a map such as defeating a boss, clearing an objective, or party wipe. -50 % to +50 % in steps of 20 % positive or 10 % negative. Encourages experimenting to find a good build. Every x number of monsters killed (x being the party size) removes 1 negative morale %.

**Combat Boosters**
Effects such as Vigor (from GW2) that increase stamina regeneration. Or True Strike which increase crit chance to spike a boss phase. Made with skills or triggered with other things such as weapon mods or perks. Other examples are Timewarped (quickness or recharge speed), and Increased Attack Speed which is tied to skills and enchantments.

**Stances**
Melee combat or caster stances. Think defensive stance or mantra.

**Multitude of status types dependant on added content & class fantasies**
Will or will not be made during development or expansions. Anything from shouts, chants, weapon spells, effects of carried items etc.

**Status Effect interactions**
Status Effects interact with other game mechanics in the following ways
- Weapon Affixes, Armor Runes, Environmental Effects, or Perks might increase or decrease or cause or remove status effects.
- In case of blindness or samblindness only the more severe condition is effecting the target character.
- Players might have resistance so certain effects reducing their hit rate or strength.
- Durations don't usually stack. Needs playtesting.

#### Inventory
Players have a personal inventory (and a bank).

**Encumberance**
Encumberance slows down player 1-33% based on how much extra they are carrying. Encumberance amount is this low and gradual because it would be very annoying to trudge half speed once you pick up one extra apple your doctor wants you to loot. 

Not applicable in PvP but there carrying certain objective items might slow the characters. 

Encumberance slow down speed is in addition to other slow down effects.

Encumberance inventory is based on Strength but either 10-20-30-40 slots based on Strength. Items have no weight per se. With 0 Str the player has 10 slots to store items and using 1 slot slows you down 33 % / 10 * 1 = 3.3 %.

Encumberance inventory needs to be cleared in an outpost before going out adventuring again.

**Equipment slots in inventory**
The character has slots for their gear including rings, armor (encompassing pretty much everything DnD-style), left hand weapon, right hand weapon. Might not do back pieces and trinkets.

All in all there are at least 5 slots + swap.

Looks wise there are more extensive customization slots for each armor location in another tab.

Needs playtesting to see player reaction to limited item amount. This would be a way to cut costs and reduce complexity.

**Weapons quick swap slots in combat**
Players have up to 4 equipment slots but 2 if doing GW2 style skill bar swaps on weapon swap which lead to samey builds but more casual friendly curated experience where playing is actually fun and skill bars are not one-sided and boring. Swapping sets pushes the weapons in their old places in inventory or to the beginning of inventory.

#### Combat
Combat is the main activity in the game with most work behind it development resources wise(?).

**Combat modes**
- Real-time
	- Pvp
- Real-time with pause
	- PvE. Used in single or multiplayer games like Summoner.
	- Dad/Mom league PvP. Could be fun experimental way to support parent players. Opt in. Otherwise timeouts could be requested in some PvP mode to discuss strats mid game.

Turn-based is not supported but would make for fun skill and combat design. Games such as PoEternity have added turn based mode post launch(?). Some skills have been designed turn based mode in mind when the idea was to make a roguelike game. It is important to keep turn based in back of the mind when designing content. Energy cost imo works better in real-time while some other kind of action point economy works in turn based or it could do without as a turn is an action is a skill use.

**Skill mechanics and combat rules (hits, misses, criticals etc)**

Hitting is a die roll that is affected by core hit percentage and dex modifiers and skill use modifier and also perk & status effect modifiers.

The design goal is that most hits should hit. If simulated as a d20 system rolling a natural 1 would mean a crit failure and a miss (5 % chance) and nat 20 a critical success or a critical hit (5 % chance). On top of that small un-DnD chance to not hit there are several modifiers:
- Own Dexterity lowers hitting threshold
- Target Dexterity raises hitting threshold
- Using a skill other than basic attack raises hit chance by 2 points. I.e. rolling 1 on hit with skill use is a roll of 3 which hits if target has less than 2 dex (defender's advantage).
- Weapon being masterwork and above is already accounted for this, but if the weapon is not masterwork or above, hitting with it is 1 or 2 die steps harder depending on weapon quality.
	- When player starts the game with a crude weapon their hit chance might be 85 % (auto attack), 95 % chance with skill use.

Missing a hit does not do any damage but uses the resources used to cast (energy, recharge) and if auto-attacking resets the auto-attack skill-chain if any.

Critical Hit is a hit that has one in twenty i.e. 5 % chance by default for melee and ranged weapons (i.e. sword and bow, not wand or staff). It does not apply to spells except if raised by True Strike or by some other means.

Critical hit damage is very roughly about 1.4 times of regular damage (crit chance stacking is not encouraged because it is not double damage and high crit chance harder to achieve). Most weapons use 2 die to calculate damage + sometimes baseline and extras. In those cases cases one die is added with max damage on the roll.
- Melee crit chance baseline 5 %
- Spell crit chance baseline 0 %
	- Spells can be a lot more costly and spiky and easy to land and that would be bad for PvE.
	- Spell crit is 1.5 damages single damage number spells and 1 extra full die if 2 damage rolls and 1 half die extra if single die
	- For example a channel spell that deals 1d4 damage + bonuses would get d4/2 extra damage from crit on top of that. 
	- A spell that deals 30 damage would deal 45 damage (straight 1.5 multiplier in this case).
	- A spell that deals 5 + 2d12 dmg (max 29-32 range) would deal 5+2d12+12 (max 41-44 range) for a boost of 39-41 %.
	- Spell damage boost from spirit is not affected by crit.

**Weapon types**

Melee weapons
- Need close range to hit (depends on weapon reach).
- 5 % baseline weapon crit chance
- Types such as sword, greatsword, axe, dagger(s), hammer. The limiting factor here is mainly animations and models, effects.
- Hits if target is close enough (gw2 style) or perhaps if target is close enough when hit should connect (gw1 style). Needs playtesting. ARPG style would lend more to GW2 action combat style where you can easily waste your skill, in that regard GW1 is good at saving your resources for confirmed hits.

Ranged weapons
- Various ranges
- Weapons such as bows, wands, staves
- 5 % baseline weapon crit chance except for wands and staves
- Some bows are almost guaranteed to hit due to arrow flight speed and movement speed not being able to dodge that.
- Wand or stave projectiles are easier to dodge and can't crit
- Wand or stave projectile auto-attack gets +spi to hit chance if it isn't evaded by movement as a homing feature.
- Modified wand or staff autos are not necessarily projectiles with these limitations. Modified spellcasting weapon attacks include types such as hitscan Beam or close range cone AoE.

Magical weapons
- Weapons can have all kinds of damage types.
- Magical weapons in DnD have +1 to hit chance and damage. In Sormus any weapon can have magical qualities (except crude weapons) and being a magical weapon does not offer bonuses to damage or hit chance per se.

Hit-scan weapons
- Some spells are hit-scan, for example laser beam type spells (see D3 for reference). Of course many spells are also just spawn x at target (initial or changed location depending on spell).
- As for hitscan Weapons there ain't much of those except crossbows if they are implemented.

Projectiles
- Some spells emit a projectile which can in theory be evaded with movement.
- Wand and stave throw a projectile (depends if modified).

**How to craft a weapon**
Player can craft weapons realiably up to masterwork and even further with higher crafting skill and Knowledge stat with the next tier being a % chance. Weapon rarity dictates number of modifications and a slight damage boost from -1 to +3 depending on number of tiers and a hit chance boost (-1 to +1 with Masterwork and above).

The crafting interface shows craftable weapon types and required materials. Materials can include x, y and z that can be gained by looting or buying. Crafting is done in towns. 

Enhancing weapons with affixes is also done in towns or crafting places in the wild.

When a weapon type is selected in a crafting UI the player begins crafting with the help of head crafter. It is a simple timer. When the timer finishes the player gets the crafted weapon. It might be that a skin and upgrade component materials can be inputted as well.

Enhancing weapons to higher rarity (up to Epic) can be done in towns as well. It costs same mateials as making it and can fail? Enhancing components can be done the same way but that requires different items and it can also fail.

Crafting an item type always start at the basic version if player has never crafted one before and output the crude version most of the time. Crafting awards xp and crafting xp and the items can be left to be sold by the blacksmith or whichever crafter type you visited.

#### Creatures

**Monsters**
There are many types of monsters (depending on budget).

**Animals**
Animals are not the main target in this game though sometimes they are hostile or controlled by the shadow. The goal is not to slaughter birds and boars and bears by the thousands.

There are not a lot of animals (there were more in the past and that is shown in cutscenes from the past in memory echos).

**NPCs**
NPCs live in the world and can do combat or talk to the player or other NPCs.

**Creature abilities and attack types**
Human-like creatures have same kind of abilities as the player including perks. Monsters might have monster perks.

Creatures attack with skills just like the player, one can see the skill activation in the UI. Playing the UI is discouraged by actions such as making it harder to know what the monster is casting until some of the cast time has elapsed. Some skills monsters use are specific to monsters and not available for the player but the player might get inspired by those skills to unlock the player equivalent skill to be mastered.

#### Dialogue
Dialogue is (depending on team strengths) semi-branching narrative with options to drive the conversation. The style might be old school topic based or options that let you roleplay the way your character would respond. The player has agency and opinions and is not a blank slate.

There sometimes can be optional skill checks such as insight or intimidate, or persuasion.

There is a deduction game mechanics that can unlock more options in the dialogue options along the story but things are also automatically deduced in time if the player does not enjoy that system. 

**Exactly how does it work**
The player can speak with an NPC which does a dialogue scene or just opens up an UI depending on if it is a story thing or not. Then cinematics can play out while characters speak and when the player can say something they say something when the user picks an option. If there is rolling the UI shows the results and proceeds accordingly.

Maximum number of dialogue choices in the dialogue UI is about 6 if there are emergent choices but usually they are much less. In case the team goes with topical selections (PoE1) there can be a lot of topics to choose from relating to lore, quests, quest rewards, starting shopping etc.

Branching structure can be made with no restrictions (paths, jumps, item or knowledge requirements etc). Will update this later after using dialogue plugin.

// Todo, ???
- Skill influence on dialogue and NPC reactions. 
- Mutual impact of dialogue and NPC reactions.

#### Stealth
Stealth is an important feature that, duh, avoids detection and can unlock bonus damage or surprise round (in DnD terms so to speak). 
Stealth can be achieved with lighting, sound and cover, and visibility.

Npcs can detect the player through sound and visibility.

Quests have stealth paths where applicable. Main story quests should support stealth. 

Stealth gameplay also includes things like lock picking and taking other routes than the main one.

If the NPCs see the player doing stealth actions they might "react accordingly".

The player can gauge who they're stealthed to and where there is safe zones to sneak (edges of darkness) and possibly see what parts of themselves are visible.

#### Locks
The game has some locked chests but more often the chests are open. There is a minigame for opening a locked chest. A skyrim-like minigame, but better of course. The player can see where they left the lockpick the last time or there are more cues to better remember what was the exact point the player tried previous time, and maybe times before, for example a supporting tool that shows degrees. The lock also becomes a bit more lenient on each failure if the try was close enough. There is also an opportunity to skip lockpicking and succeed by paying a certain number of lockpicks (e.g. hard chest guarantees opening by 10th lockpick and then you wait the character to lockpick). Higher dexterity and possibly Kno makes both manual and non-manual lockpicking easier.

Locked chests are present more in the story but the dungeoning has less of them. 

Locked doors can offer shortcuts, extra loot or extra secrets. Another way to open a door is through force which makes sound or sometimes by finding a key.

Difficulty levels of locks are multiple with 3 or 4 levels.

Lockpicking interacts with character stats and perks if any (including class perks). Skills can also influence chests and lockpicking.

#### Companions
Companions can be a way to experience the story with some help. Companions would be in addition or in stead of playing with friend(s).

Companion system might be a mercenary system at start (see Guild Wars: Prophecies) that take some of your drops and gold and have a pre-made skill bar as that is easier and faster to make and less complex, rather than the players having to manage companions skills and gear.

Companion(s) follow who added them to the party and do combat when needed and perhaps do other mechanics when needed.

Companion(s) are limited to a number depending on the area or content. The number is NOT dependant on player choices or stats or skills (except for animal companion if there is any).

There are no restrictions regarding companions, they all will gladly follow you (no morality concerns). 

Companions/mercenaries are not integral to the story and don't have their own quests (but they should).

#### Economy
The game gives players resources in the form of loot and other rewards that come from doing activities.

When adventuring the gold that is gained is spread to all party members. The items that drop are too unless modified by party rules.

**Loot from monsters**
Monsters have loot tables. They can drop gold and items. Experience is a loot type that does not have UI representation.

**Loot from chests**
Chests drop loot to the ground and it is then distributed or free to pick. Chests have also loot tables and some chests have guaranteed loot to fit the game progression or pacing.

**Picking up loot**
Some loot picking is automatic (those that take no space). The game does not leave loot on the ground so the player has an amount of unpicked items in their backup loot section if they leave the instance. Backup loot prioritizes rare and quest items.

##### Vendors
Some NPCs are vendors. Some NPCs are vendors among other things. Some PLAYERS are vendors! There is no global marketplace.

**Vendors as vendors**
Vendors have a assortion of things they sell, some QoL stuff like sell trophies, and they can buy certain items from the player. Vendors have unlimited gold. Some vendors might have rotating/randomizing wares but nothing too extreme.

**Players as vendors**
A player can have a selling inventory and other people can buy from that. This encourages players to socialize and be online. There is of course also personal trade for non-monetary trades.

#### Crafting
Crafting is a part of the game but not a grand journey (as of yet). The idea is not to be busywork grind for all players but something people can take part in if they want to.

**Incentives to crafting**
Crafting is not a sink per se when leveling money wise if you have the materials yourself. You can sell your items to the blacksmith that sells them forward for example.

Crafting is an easy way to make high quality weapons in certain styles or to improve a weapon.

**Material sources**
Loot drops from chests and enemies. Bones, iron bars. Iron ore from mines, feathers, scales, magic dusts, wood, magical runes or equivalent.

**Craftable items**
Armor and weapons. Something else? Upgrades for gear.

Food crafting would be interesting but is not tied to combat mechanics, maybe for extra xp gain boosters and such. There can however be many kinds of crafting if the game's scope is increased but limiting crafting is an easy way to cut scope.

Examples of crafted items: 
- Longbow (Crude), non max damage
- Hearty Iron Dagger (Masterwork), max damage

Examples of upgrades: 
- Hearty lesser bowstring +22 hp -> Hearty bowstring +25 hp
- Hearty lesser bowstring +22 hp -> Hearty lesser bowstring +24 hp
- Lesser Crippling sword hilt 15 % -> Crippling Sword Hilt (33%)
- of Slaying -> of Strength

#### Screens and UI Elements
These pertain to things like inventory screen, shop screen, and even larger things like the whole character creation UI, skill trees, and things that could take up the whole screen and not just a part of it.

**Log in Screen**
When the game is started there is a log in screen that logs the player in with the backends of choice (or none if playing offline). There could be multiple ways to log in (eventually at least).

**Character Selection Screen**
After the Log in screen the player chooses which existing character to play or makes a new character or deletes an existing character.

*Character deletion modal*
When a button is pressed to delete a chosen character an are you sure message shows on a modal and an input field where the player must either write DELETE or the characters name or such to delete it. When delete or cancel button is pressed on the modal the player is then deleted. 

*Character Slot*
The player has a set amount of character slots. A slot might show a sneak peek of a character. The actual implementation of choosing the character to use or change. 

[Reference of A character selection screen with character slots in Guild Wars MMO](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Character_selection_screen)

Implementation in Sormus might differ greatly from references but the goal is to have an exciting 3D environment or painted one and the player's own 3D rotateable characters showing on the screen in front of that background.

**Character Creation Screen**
Character creation screens are located at the very start of the game, before the player can control the new character (unless the character selection is a "playable section"). Currently there is no set in stone plans of how this experience would play out but the contents of the character creation include setting up appearance, name, and starting stats and skills.

It could be possible that some if it would be a 3D level like in FO4 or PoExiles.

**Character Info Screen**
In game stats and info kind of screen that in many rpgs show all kinds of info about resistances, hit chances and such, in some of these the character model is displayed and the character's gear. In some games stats screen and gear screen is separated and in some games they are in the same window.

		- EA
			- More of the same.
			- First 4 boss city Raid
		- Full
			- COULD have PvP. Not on the table though.
			- COULD have player housing.
			- Etc
	- Comparison of different games in the genre how much playtime they offer (maybe indie versions... as can't compete with AAA with the same content)
		- Hours are for main story
		- --- ARPs
		- PoE1 (30 hours), PoE2 (35 hours)
		- Diablo 2: Resurrected (22 hours), Diablo 3 (18 hours), Diablo 4 (22 hours)
		- Last Epoch (Early Access, 22 hours)

		- Titan Quest II (Early Access, 11.5 hours)
		- Darksiders: Genesis (17 hours)
		- --- 

**Cutting Room Floor - What the project does not have**
- Collecting crafting materials from nature
- Crafting _everything_ on your own, there might be crafter NPCs (GW) that you can buy services from
- Romance Options
- Player Housing (later could be a good addition)
- Card Games (card items could be way to tell lore)
- Playable Instruments
- Extensive Anticheat
- PvP (later could be a good addition, this PvE game is balanced around PvP, just like Guild Wars, not dealing 14 billion damage 200 times a minute)
- Mounts
- Truckload of Custom models
- Long lasting consumable buffs as (food and Utility)
- Buff based gameplay that enforces a class meta where you need to maintain a buff list (might, fury, quickness, alacrity, vigor etc). Can leave out a lot of skills and multiclass nature of the game helps too.
- Open World: the world is split into areas that can be added over time (Guild Wars 1 & 2)
- Base building (Bethesda-like)

**Budget**
You can throw as many millions as you want in 3D RPGs which demand skills in dozens of disciplines. Games like Final Fantasy VII (1998), Final Fantasy VII Remake (2020), and Baldurs Gate 3 (2023) had budgets of over 100 million as do many MMOs. Name a single super popular RPG and chances are the total budget was somewhere around 100 mil and sales sometimes in 300 mil range.

Let's say a single developer costs 100 000 a year and you have 30 of them and production lasts for 5 years. That is 15 million, and then there are additional costs on top of that come anywhere from marketing, localisation, testing, voice acting, additional freelancers, porting, renting and running a workplace & studio, dev equipment etc.

For this game much is done in shoestring fashion until funding. Budget is in the air as of writing.

Funding plans: Epic MegaGrant, Tempo funding from Business Finland Tempo & R&D maybe (terms might be so that if not paid back the game needs to be delisted), additional sources such as Sisu Game Ventures & Supercell Investments etc, Crowdfunding, possibly SpeedRun investors.

**Timeline**
A game of this scope takes years to make, possibly 5+. A year or so could be and should be spent just in pre production.

*Example production timeline*
2025
Nov & Dec: Story planning, Content planning, Design specification
2026 (planned)
- Design continues whole year, sometimes in a just in time fashion, but a proper design specification should be made before July (100+ pages). 
2026
January: Act 1 level blockouts 
February: Quest & Dialogue plugin integration
March: Features for first feedback oriented demo (deadline in May)
April: Same as March: content, features & fixes
May: Demo 1, start looking for collaborators for better value proposition (for funding)
June: Demo update as monthly deliverable
July: first Epic MegaGrant application
December: Act 1 horizontal slice v1 (quests, proc gen dungeon if works)
2027
January: second Epic MegaGrant application
Middle of the year: Other funding
2028
Q1: Act 1 vertical slice

*Release Timeline*
2027 - feedback builds 
2029 - Publisher demo that makes a deal
2029 - Alpha
2030 - Beta
Realistic Early Access release 30/12/2030 or 2031

### Monetization

Monetisation model (business model) decides how the game is continued to be made or made in the first place
- For example in F2P HS the whole game is getting cards and every once in a while the game takes your hard earned cards away when the set rotates
	- The studio is optimizing for adding new sets to sell
- For example in B2P GW2 the business model is expansions and cosmetic and QoL microtransactions

In Sormus 
	- New content basically bundled as Locations (basically dungeons + some social hubs)
		- Unlock a location from the cartographer that shows a new location in the mist.
		- New Items might be found there?
		- New Spells and attacks might originate from there but they rotate so that everyone can use them eventually without buying so kinda first come first serve system.
		- New story is there (not much but some?).
	- Optimal Spend
		- some QoL more characters 10 eur
		- cosmetics that speak to you 5 eur
		- some Locations you're excited about

Reputation needs to be kept good meaning no shady cash grabs.

### Game Design

**Game Economy**

Sinks
- Mandatory spends
- Infinite Sinks


---
### Assets
The game will use a lot of modified marketplace assets.
