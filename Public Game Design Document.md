**Game genre, short introduction**
Fantasy CRPGs (Computer Role-Playing Games) with online elements have been a thing for over 45 years. Fast forward to current times there's two or three main categories of CRPGs: primarily single player RPGs with either soulslike or tactical approach, or MMORPGs. CRPGs borrowed heavily from TTRPGs like Dungeons & Dragons.

See Game loops for more info.

**Sormus as a game**
An elevator pitch would be something like this:
Imagine a world where the sun hasn't risen for a generation about to experience a massive upheaval as gates to other dimensions open to fill the shadows with new dangers and old legends raise their heads in a cry towards a new order.

Create a character. Create a playstyle. Change the world (minor). Learn about the past. Forge the future. Fight bosses. Change the world (major). Celebrate. Mourn. Purify.

A visually sound experience paired with battle-tested pen and paper -like mechanics.

A game meant to restart your agency.

Emotional and epic story.

**Superior Pillars**
o Everyone should be able to play
- Pursue flow state without requiring perfect execution, this is power fantasy.
- Casual players is a segment that could become strong allies, it's a value to let everyone play, to let everyone be able to experience the story.
o Aim for an immersive experience, not a game
- Stories are eternal. They need to be told convincingly.
- Immersiveness adds value & transcends our messages into the real world.
- Reimagining games moves the industry forward.
- Is this too gamy?
- If realism is against fun, side with the fun.
o Nourish Creativity & Connection
- Humans are social animals and want to show their individuality through fashion, builds, choices
- Humans crave community in hyper individualistic age, provide that
**Major Pillars**
o Placeholder
**Minor Pillars**
o Anything is possible with creativity

**Why is it fun?**
Sandboxiness, action combat, great story, roguelike moments, customization, multiplayer

**Why do the players keep coming back (Retention)?**
- Time gated content
- Sandbox nature
- Takes a long time to experience everything
- Story content is not good bang for buck for retention.

**What do the enemies do?**
Use largely same skills as players. 

**Game loops**
The main loops of an rpg consist of growing stronger and experiencing more of the story.
Popular activities in rpgs are clearing dungeons, gearing up, customizing your character and playstyle, creating characters in different archetypes, getting achievements, achieving long term goals, achieving mastery, teaming up with others for content, clearing hard content, unlocking new content, replaying story if it has replay value, completing quests.

*Gearing up*
Find better or more fitting gear for your character with bonuses that benefit your playstyle. To get more gear you need to play the game to find those drops, or get money to buy or craft gear. Once you have better gear you can experience more content or the same content. To get some gear you need well geared characters. No gear treadmill though.

*Clearing dungeons*
A roguelikeish experience that offers replay value and exciting moments. Thriving in this environment is easier with a well progressed character (via dungeons exp/drops) or with friends.

*Filling community goals*
Progressing in the game sometimes requires participation from the whole community. The player does for example procedural content to fill the goal. The story and progress in the world is gated like in Sea of Conquest: Pirate War. This is a recurring thing.

*Progressing in the story*
Requires community goals, beating bosses, finding items, playing content. Story is made for each expansion.

*Customizing playstyle*
Player plays to unlock more skills and gear to play more or in the fashion they choose.

**Story**
The story takes place in a continent known as Xylrea that has experienced a long lasting darkness but people have survived, often by magical means to grow food.

A new age begins, as does your story. Long forgotten portals open and new puzzling futures are divinated. The player experiences a story half told, half untold by taking a look into the past, to different days, and then forging the future with the help of other heroes.

Currently there's 150 years of history, in media res starting point for the players, beginning and end, and story outline. The story is a combination of hopepunk and a splash of portal fantasy in a dark fantasy setting. There's a focus on stories experienced by real people in this totally real land.

### Production

**Project Scope**
- Total playtime Casual (30+) vs Midcore (hundreds) vs Core (thousands)
	- How many towns/cities/outputs
	- How many levels (and which are replayable)
	- How many items
	- How many skills
	- How many perks
	- How much content is needed for demo, EA and full
	- What game modes are needed for demo, EA and full
	- Comparison of different games in the genre how much playtime they offer (maybe indie versions... as can't compete with AAA with the same content)

**Cutting Room Floor - What the project does not have**
- Crafting: collecting materials or crafting on your own, there might be crafter NPCs (GW)
- Romance Options
- Player Housing (later could be a good addition)
- Card Games
- Playable Instruments
- Extensive Anticheat
- PvP
- Mounts
- Truckload of Custom models
- Long lasting consumable buffs as (food and Utility)
- Buff based gameplay (can leave out a lot of skills)
- Open World: the world is split into areas that can be added over time (GWs)
- Base building

**Budget**
You can throw as many millions as you want in 3D RPGs which demand skills in dozens of disciplines. Games like Final Fantasy VII (1998), Final Fantasy VII Remake (2020), and Baldurs Gate 3 (2023) had budgets of over 100 million as do many MMOs. Name a single super popular RPG and chances are the total budget was somewhere around 100 mil and sales sometimes in 300 mil range.

Let's say a single developer costs 100 000 a year and you have 30 of them and production lasts for 5 years. That is 15 million, and then there are additional costs on top of that come anywhere from marketing, localisation, testing, voice acting, additional freelancers, porting, renting and running a workplace & studio, dev equipment etc.

For this game much is done in shoestring fashion until funding. Budget is in the air as of writing.

Funding plans: Epic MegaGrant, Tempo funding from Business Finland, additional sources, Crowdfunding, possibly SpeedRun investors (though they are interested in multiplayer).

**Timeline**
A game of this scope takes years to make, possibly 5+.

A year or so could be and should be spent just in pre production.

*Example production timeline*
2025
Nov & Dec: Story planning, Content planning, Design specification
2026 (planned)
- Design continues whole year, sometimes in a just in time fashion, but a proper design specification should be made before July (100+ pages). 
January: Act 1 level blockouts 
February: Quest & Dialogue plugin integration
March: Features for first feedback oriented demo (May)
April: Same as march: content, features & fixes
May: Demo 1, start looking for collaborators for better value proposition (for funding)
June: Demo update as monthly deliverable
July: Epic MegaGrant application
October: Act 1 demo horizontal slice
December: Act 1 vertical slice v1 (quests, proc gen dungeon if works) 

*Release Timeline*
2026 - mostly private builds
2027 - builds to ask feedback within igda playtests
*insert some sort of time warp*
2028 - publisher demo that makes a deal, alpha
*insert some sort of time warp*
2029 - beta, ea earliest dec 2029 (4 years in development, might not cut it)
realistic EA release 12/2030 or 12/2031 (5-6 years in development)

### Monetization

Monetisation model (business model) decides how the game is continued to be made or made in the first place
- For example in F2P HS the whole game is getting cards and every once in a while the game takes your hard earned cards away when the set rotates
	- The studio is optimizing for adding new sets to sell
- For example in B2P GW2 the business model is expansions and cosmetic and QoL microtransactions

In Sormus 
	- New content basically bundled as Locations (basically dungeons + some social hubs)
		- Unlock a location from the cartographer that shows a new location in the mist.
		- New Items might be found there?
		- New Spells and attacks might originate from there but they rotate so that everyone can use them eventually without buying so kinda first come first serve system.
		- New story is there (not much but some?).
	- Optimal Spend
		- some QoL more characters 10 eur
		- cosmetics that speak to you 5 eur
		- some Locations you're excited about

Reputation needs to be kept good meaning no shady cash grabs.
